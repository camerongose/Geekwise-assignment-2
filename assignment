Create a directive with restriction "A", call it listmore

when listMore is clicked 
call a method on yout controller

Your controller should have two methods:

1- countDownFromFive
2- countUpToFice

console.log the output of you controller

Bonus: On rollover, have your directive add the :label: 
class to its <div>. Remove that class on roll out
